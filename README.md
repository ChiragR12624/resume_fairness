# Bias in Resume Screening

One-liner: This project investigates bias in machine learning models for resume screening, evaluates fairness using standard metrics, and applies algorithmic debiasing techniques to improve equity in automated hiring decisions.

## Day 1 deliverables
- Project scaffold and environment
- Bias dimensions: gender, ethnicity
- Fairness metric definitions (disparate impact, demographic parity, equal opportunity)
- Data schema (`data/README.md`)
